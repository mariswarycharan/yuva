Title of the event NATIONAL E-MICROMOUSE CHALLENGE
Description of the event The participants are required to build an autonomous,
self-contained robot, Micromouse, that negotiates a maze of standard dimensions
from a specified corner which will start on the START tile and reach the FINISH
tile at the center in the shortest possible time. A Micromouse essentially comprises of a drive motor or
motors to move it; a steering and turning method; sensors to detect the
presence or absence of maze walls; sensors or control logic to oversee the
action of the rest and keep the vehicle 'on track' or to solve the maze;
batteries to provide power.
A. Objective:
The participants are required to build an autonomous, self-contained robot, Micromouse, that negotiates a maze of standard dimensions from a specified corner which will start on the START tile and reach the FINISH tile at the center in the shortest possible time. A Micromouse essentially comprises of a drive motor or motors to move it; a steering and turning method; sensors to detect the presence or absence of maze walls; sensors or control logic to oversee the action of the rest and keep the vehicle 'on track' or to solve the maze; batteries to provide power.
B. Contest Eligibility:
1. One team can have a maximum of 4 members.
2. This is an open round competition which can be participated by any individuals or teams irrespective of their institutions. Students from different institutes can be a part of same team.
3. All students with a valid identity card of their respective educational institutions are eligible to participate in the competition.
4. There is no limit to the number of teams that one college may register for this competition.
C. Micromouse Specification
1. Fabrication:
The Micromouse robot submitted by a team must be designed and built from scratch.
2. Self Containment:
The Micromouse robot shall be self-contained (no remote controls). The robot shall not use an energy source employing a combustion process.
3. Dislodged Parts:
The Micromouse robot shall not separate from any part of itself while navigating the maze. To complete the maze, the robot in its entirety must enter the centre of the maze.
4. Method of Movement:
The Micromouse robot shall not jump over, fly over, climb, scratch, cut, burn, mark, damage, or destroy the walls of the maze.
5. Micromouse Size:
The Micromouse robot shall not be larger either in length or in width than 16 cm. There are no restrictions on the height of the robot.
6. Wall Sensing:
The method of wall sensing is at the discretion of the builder. However, the mouse must not exert a force on any wall to cause damage.
7. Inspection:
All Micromouse robots are subject to inspection prior to starting their competition, to ensure they are within the specifications outlined by these rules, and that they do not pose potential safety hazards.
8. Rules Violation:
Any violation of these rules will constitute immediate disqualification from the contest and ineligibility for any associated prizes.
D. Maze Specification
1. Maze Dimensions:
The maze is composed of 18cm x 18cm unit squares arranged to form a 16 x 16 unit grid. The walls of the units of the maze are 6 cm high and 1.2 cm thick (assume 5% tolerance for mazes). Passageways between the walls shall be 16.8 cm wide, an outside wall encloses the entire maze.
2. Maze Coloration:
The sides of the maze walls are white, the tops of the walls are red, and the floor is black. The maze is made of wood.
3. Maze Fabrication Inconsistencies:
Do not assume the walls are consistently white, or that the tops of the walls are consistently red, or that the floor is consistently black. Fading may occur and parts from different mazes may be used. Do not assume the floor provides a given amount of friction. It is simply painted plywood and may be quite slick. The maze floor may be constructed using multiple sheets of plywood. The change of slope at an assembly joint shall not be greater than 0.5 mm. Gaps between the walls of adjacent squares shall not be greater than 1 mm.
4. Start/End Zones:
The starting square of the maze is located at one of the four corners. The starting square is bounded on three sides by walls. The start line is located between the first and second squares. As the mouse exits the corner square (signified by crossing the start line), the run timer starts. The destination is a gateway to the four-unit square at the centre of the maze. The destination square has only one gateway. And the timer stops once it reaches the destination square.
5. Lattice Points:
Small square posts, each 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm, at the four corners of each unit square are called lattice points. The maze is assembled so that there is at least one wall at each lattice point, except for the destination square.
6. Multiple Paths:
Multiple paths from the starting square to the destination square are allowed and should be expected.
E. Competition Rules
1. Time:
Each team is allocated 10 minutes of access to the maze, starting when the competition administrator acknowledges the team and grants access to the maze. Any time used to adjust the team’s Micromouse robot between runs is included in these 10 minutes. A run-time is recorded for each run (from the start cell to the center zone) in which the robot successfully reaches the destination square. The minimum run time within the 10-minute trial shall be the mouse’s official time. The micromouse may make up to 7 runs.
2. Stopping/Removing:
Each run shall be made from the starting square. Multiple runs, or run attempts, may be made within the allotted 10 minute maze time. The team may abort a run at any time, and return the Micromouse robot to the starting square. If the robot has reached the destination square and has acquired a “run time,” the robot may take the maze back to the corner starting square on its own. Alternatively, it may be removed at any time without affecting the runtime of that run. If the robot is placed back in the maze at the starting square, a one-time penalty of 10 seconds will be added to the robot’s next run time.
3. Reprogramming After Reveal:
After the competition maze is revealed to the teams at the start of the competition, the operator shall not reprogram his or her Micromouse robot but may elect to change the positions of switches located on the robot.
4. Room Conditions:
The illumination, temperature, and humidity of the room shall be those of an ambient environment. (40 to 120 degrees F, 0% to 95% humidity, non-condensing).
5. Ambient Lighting:
Do not make any assumptions about the amount of sunlight, incident light, or fluorescent light or any shadows that may be present at the competition site.
6. Run Time:
The run timer will start when the front edge of the Micromouse robot crosses the start line and stops when the front edge of the mouse crosses the finish line. The start line is at the boundary between the starting unit square and the next unit square clockwise. The finish line is at the entrance to the destination square.
7. Starting a Run:
Every time the Micromouse robot leaves the starting square, a new run begins. If the robot does not enter the destination square, no runtime is recorded. For example, if the robot re-enters the starting square (before entering the destination square) on a run, that run is aborted, and a new runtime will begin when the robot leaves the starting square.
8. Continued Navigation:
If the Micromouse robot continues to navigate the maze after reaching the destination square, the time taken will not count toward any run. The robot may and should make several runs without being touched by the operator. Once the robot has found the centre, it is common practice to explore the maze via an alternate path on the return trip to the starting square.
9. Modifying the Robot:
The team may not feed information about the maze to the Micromouse robot. Therefore, changing ROMs or downloading programs is NOT allowed once the maze is revealed.
However, participants are allowed to do the following:
● Change switch settings (e.g., to select algorithms).
● Replace batteries between runs.
● Adjust sensors.
● Change speed settings.
● Make repairs.
10. Changing the Robot’s Weight:
After the team’s 10 minute time allotment begins, they shall not alter their Micromouse robot in a manner that alters its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed after mapping the maze is not allowed). The judges shall arbitrate all interactions with the robot. The contestants should be prepared with the circuit diagrams, algorithms, and code listings to convince the judges that any alteration they do in the total 5 minutes span does not add topological information about the maze to the mouse.
F. Judging Criteria
Winners will be decided on the basis of the shortest handicap time, which is calculated as; Handicap Time = Best Run Time + Touch Penalty
(Touch Penalty = X * 2 sec, where X = Number of touches to the best run) For example, if a Micromouse, after being on the maze for 10 minutes,
starts a run that takes 20 seconds to reach the destination after being. touched thrice; the run will have a Handicap time of 20 + (3*2) = 26 seconds.
If Micromouse does not reach the centre of the maze, then the Micromouse will be ranked by the judges based on the following criteria;
• How close the robot gets to the destination square without being touched.
• Evidence that the mouse knows where it is relative to the destination square and the quality of control.
G. Important Note
● The machine may be checked for its safety before the race and will be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators. The name of your machine must be prominently displayed on the machine.
● Judge's decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.
● The organizers reserve the right to change any or all the above rules as they deem fit.  Change in rules, if any, will be notified to the registered participants.
H. Certificate Policy
E-Certificates will be given to all the teams participated. Disqualified teams will not be
considered for any certificates.
